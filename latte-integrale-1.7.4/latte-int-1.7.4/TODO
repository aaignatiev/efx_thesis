Algorithmic TODO:

* Implement irrational decomposition for the homogenized case.
   Currently ResidueFunction_Single_Cone and ResidueFunction assume
   unshifted cones (vertex == 0), so irrational decomposition does not
   work currently.

* Implement exponential substitution for the homogenized case.


Code clean-up:

* Residue calculations:
   - "Re-implement" Residue in terms of Residue_Single_Cone (Residue.cpp).
   - Likewise, consolidate ResidueFunction (RudyResNTL.cpp) and
      ResidueFunction_Single_Cone (ResSingle.cpp)
   - Factor out construction of generic vector.

* Main programs:
   Factor out code.

* Remove:
   - CreateExample.cpp (or move to test-suite generators)

* Reading CDD-style input files currently segfaults
  because CheckEmpty is not prepared to deal with CDD files.
  (what is CheckEmpty good for?)

* Replace the broken CDD-style parser
  with a call to cddlib functions.

* dualize & dualizeback want to be one function, dispatching over
  simplicial/non-simplicial case.

* Handle "-" to mean "read from stdin".

Bug fixes:

* Vertex cone computation via CDD thinks the polytope is empty when
  there is only the "trivial vertex" 0.

Documentation:


Configuration:

* Make compile and run with compilers other than g++

* All programs should understand --help and --version. 
  Then add std-options to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE, so that this is checked 
  at `make installcheck'.
