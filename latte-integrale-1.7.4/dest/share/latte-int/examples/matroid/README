I've attached all the data I have. The file ``haws.oxleybasis.txt'' is the basis description as given to me by Gordon Royle for his Oxley list. See http://people.csse.uwa.edu.au/
gordon/oxley-list.html

``haws.oxleybasis.alldata.tar.gz''

contains:

    haws.oxleybasis.txt.l*.ext               cddr file of the vertex representation
                                                         I added the origin to make it full dimensional.
                                                         This also contains the matroid reference for Gordon Royle's webpage.
    haws.oxleybasis.txt.l*.ine              cddr's conversion of the file into ine description.

    haws.oxleybasis.txt.l*.lat              LattE ready input. I place the final equation as an equality.

The rest is the output.
