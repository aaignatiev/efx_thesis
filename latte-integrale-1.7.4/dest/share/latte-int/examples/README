birkhoff/
Doubly stochastic matrices (take a nxn matrix, each col and row sums to 1).

cpp/
complete cut polytopes on five to seven vertices. The polytopes have been scaled by 2 and then translated by 1 to contain the origin in their interor. So their vertices have coordinates +1 and -1 now. Taken from Vinci by Andreas Enge.

crossCyclic/
cc_8_7 to cc_8_11, the product of two cyclic polyhedra with seven to eleven vertices, each in dimension four. The final dimension is therefore eight. Taken from Vinci by Andreas Enge.

crosspolytope/cddStyle/ 
cross polytopes, the duals of cubes. Taken from Vinci by Andreas Enge.

cubes/
hypercubes with -1 and 1 as vertex coordinates, in dimension 2 to 14.  Taken from Vinci by Andreas Enge. Note the makeCube exe. makes latte-style cubes over [0, 1]^n.

matroid/
To do.

metric/
After expansion, contains facets of the fourth (Fm_4) to sixth (Fm_6) metric polytope. Taken from Vinci by Andreas Enge.
The metric cone M_n is defined by the following 3{n\choose 3} triangle inequalities:
    * x_{ij}-x_{ik}-x_{jk} \leq 0
      for all triples {i,j,k} subset of {1,...,n}
Then, bounding the latter by the following {n\choose 3} perimeter inequalities,
    * x_{ij}+x_{ik}+x_{jk} \leq 2 
    
random-simplex/
Random simplex polytopes.

rh/
Polytopes constructed by randomly choosing hyperplanes tangent to the sphere; after unpacking, files rh_d_m will be created, where d stands for the dimension and m for the number of hyperplanes. Taken from Vinci by Andreas Enge.

rv/
Dually to rh/, these polytopes have vertices randomly distributed on the sphere. Taken from Vinci by Andreas Enge.

tests/
Test errors and other issues when reading in polytopes.
