# EFx and PO allocations 

## Description
This repository contains code for my Bachelor thesis. My work is focused on fair allocations which are EFx and PO simultaneously. Here I've implemented two different EFx allocations counting approaches for two-agent instance: brute force and ILP. For ILP implementation I used LattE, the. software for lattice points counting.

## Repository description & Usage 
1. `latte-int` dir contains LattE library
2. `barvinok_counter` - notebook with Latte usage (input generation for the problem) for counting
3. `brute_force_EFx` - notebook with brute force method and some statistics and visualisation
